# Hangman
Simple, interactive, user-friendly game that allows the player to choose a topic and promptly gives the player a word related to that topic to guess the letters to. The user is shown the ”Hangman” figure as they play along, so it feels like a real game.

This program is written in Python and was made to allow me to get used to programming in Python
